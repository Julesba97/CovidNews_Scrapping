Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 550 million confirmed cases and more than six million deaths reported across almost 200 countries.The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Germany and the UK.Very few places have been left untouched. In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.Deaths are falling in many areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.AsiaAsia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic "fever cases" according to the state news agency. It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.EuropeReported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.North AmericaThe US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. Latin AmericaLatin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.AfricaAfrica has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.Middle EastSeveral countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. OceaniaEarly in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. Figures for France are for the mainland only and include both suspected and confirmed cases.

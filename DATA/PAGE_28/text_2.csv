A further 998 people have tested positive for Covid-19.Essential shops must stop trading each day by 20:00 GMT during first week of new measures.Non-essential shops have been forced to close.Close-contact services, such as hair salons, are also to shut, pubs, cafes and restaurants are restricted to takeaway and delivery services.Executive ministers have said they will review the lockdown after four weeks.Businesses permitted to open have to limit numbers on their premises at any one time and there is to be an expanded use of Covid marshals in the retail sector. Tighter restrictions are in place for a week from 26 December, as the executive urges people to abide by its "stay at home" rules.No gatherings - indoor or outdoor - are permitted between 20:00 and 06:00 each day.This means people are not allowed to meet others in private gardens or indoors in any setting between these times, except for emergencies or the provision of health or care services.Outdoor exercise is permitted only with members of your own household.No sporting activity is allowed at all during the first week of lockdown, but elite sport will be allowed to resume - without spectators - from 2 January.Health Minister Robin Swann said the stay-at-home message during this week would be made "legally enforceable".Police would be given "additional" enforcement powers to ensure people are only leaving their homes for essential reasons, he added.But people who routinely cross the border for essential purposes will not be subject to restrictions.It has also defined further what it constitutes as "essential travel", including for work and health reasons.There will be an increased Garda (Irish police) presence on Irish roads but road blocks will not be placed on the border to prevent travel between NI and the Republic.Christmas bubbles are still allowed, but the executive is urging people to form them only if "absolutely necessary".Some of the measures are only guidance and there is no penalty for breaking guidance, but people in Northern Ireland caught breaching coronavirus regulations can face a minimum fine of Â£200.There are also three other offences: Breaches of those laws can incur a fixed penalty notice of Â£1,000 or up to Â£10,000 on conviction.Health Minister Robin Swann has called for the stay-at-home guidance to be given legal force, in order to ensure people comply.It is not clear whether the lockdown rules could be extended after the six weeks, but the executive says it will respond in line with any developments regarding pressures on the health service.Meanwhile the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported six more coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, bringing its death toll to 2,200.A further 1,296 new Covid-19 cases were also recorded, taking the Republic's total number of confirmed cases to 85,394.

More than 12,500 people have died with coronavirus, since the first reported death in Scotland on 13 March 2020. Here are the stories of some of those who have lost their lives. Jean was born in 1937 Maryhill and spoke often and fondly of her childhood in "the Butney". This involved real hardships - including war-time evacuation to Holytown - though Jean's memories were all good and Maryhill became a touchstone when dementia became a factor in recent years.  Working at Rolls-Royce Hillington, Jean was transferred to its Derby HQ where, as a young woman, she made small component parts for jet engines. Even in her 80s, Jean could still perform all the machinist actions (with sound effects). She loved to paint landscapes and had a life-long passion for music, especially jazz (with Frankie and Ella being constants). She was a great singer and dancer, always up for fun and laughs, brightening up any party.Her family said Jean was a fabulous mum to two daughters, a brilliant friend, and a warm-hearted women with kindness for everyone and anyone. She died on 27 October 2020. Rashelle Baird's family describe her as "kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party".The 27-year-old mother-of-three from Brechin had put off appointments to get the vaccine because she was busy with her children.Her family stressed she was not anti-vaccine. "She wanted to get her vaccine but she put her kids first," her father Stephen said.Rashelle, who had asthma, initially thought she had caught a cold from her children, but her symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital.She died in November 2021 after several days in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, having been placed in an induced coma in the intensive care unit.Family's vaccine plea after 27-year-old's Covid deathDavid Trower worked as a clerical officer in the A&E department of University Hospital Monklands in Airdrie before retiring in 2016. But he was committed to the NHS and even in retirement he chose to continue to work shifts, through NHS Lanarkshire's staff bank, right up until February. He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. His colleagues thought highly of him, saying: "We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him."Bernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. She added: "The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else."Stephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. The couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from "very different" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. Stephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. Outside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. He died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45.Family of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangersNan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career.

After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a "living wake" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Graeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. On the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons.For 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. After undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. But he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas.

David Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud "papa" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning.

David lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence.

While John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house "surrounded by love", before taking work as a curtain consultant.

A loyal Aberdeen FC fan, he was one of the lucky ones - he was in Gothenburg in 1983 to see the his beloved Dons lift the European Cup Winners Cup.

As of 8 November the infection rate now stands at 279.4 per 100,000 - a reduction of nearly 72%.Pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels in the area was placed under tighter restrictions two and half weeks before the rest of Northern Ireland was placed under similar restrictions.

While there are no mink farms in NI, there are in the Republic of Ireland, including a number in Donegal, and they will be subject to Covid-19 testing.In a letter to the Irish health minister, seen by BBC News NI, Mr Swann asked his counterpart to introduce similar measures to the UK "in the interests of the safety of all citizens on our island".There are no direct flights between Northern Ireland and Denmark, so visitors and returning holidaymakers travel through Dublin airport or airports in Scotland, Wales or England.

The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has reported a record number of positive coronavirus cases within the past 24 hours.A further 2,143 people have tested positive - the highest daily total since testing began. Six people have died with the virus.The chief medical officer said the figures were "extremely troubling".Mr Swann said deployment of the vaccine is expected next week and confirmed 50,000 doses were already in Northern Ireland.There are currently 457 inpatients who have tested positive for coronavirus in NI hospitals, and 35 in Intensive Care Units.In the past seven days, 7,100 people have tested positive for coronavirus, up from 4,271 in the previous week.The seven-day incidence rate - covering December 23 to 29 - has risen to 377.3 per 100,000 of the population, up from 227 the week before. Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that the health service was "going to come under very severe pressures on top of an already pressurised system"."We always knew there would be a pay back from the two weeks of relaxations that we had in the immediate runup to Christmas," he said.Dr McBride said he was "very concerned" about what the next few weeks hold."We will see a further period of the health service having to turn down routine services whilst it copes with the increased number of Covid patients."Meanwhile, 33,683 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been administered to care home residents and front-line health staff in NI.First Minister Arlene Foster said she was delighted with the vaccine progress announced on Wednesday and said the wider vaccination programme should start across Northern Ireland next week.Speaking ahead of the Oxford-AstraZeneca approval, Mr Swann said it will take time "before we see the true benefits of vaccination"."I want people to be hopeful. I want people to look forward to 2021 but I also want people to remain cautious."He urged people to stick to the executive's Covid-19 regulations, particularly to "keep any new year celebrations within your existing household".The Department of Health said that of those who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 8,940 are care home residents, 10,484 are care home staff and 14,259 are front-line health and social care staff.Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are needed for effective protection against the virus, administered three weeks apart.All health and social care staff in Northern Ireland will be offered a Covid-19 vaccine and will be called forward "when it is their time", the department said.Meanwhile, there have been a further 13 Covid-19-related deaths in the Republic of Ireland in the past 24 hours. It brings the death toll there to 2,226.There have been 1,718 additional positive cases of the virus there.
